# Quick tutorial for the end user
The bot only takes files, no zips or any other compression like that.

## Threads
Click the create thread button in the channel that the bot's message is in, thereafter enter the thread you receive. You can do the commands there.

## Uploads
When you do a command that takes save pairs (encrypted saves which is a file and .bin corresponding to it), you can upload it straight through discord or send a public google drive folder link.

## Bulk uploads
All save pair commands accept saves in bulk, except for when you upload a save from your region when re-regioning (you can upload in bulk when you upload the ones you want to resign and re-region. Quick code command also accepts multiple savegames.

## Commands
**common parameter**: playstation_id, YOUR PLAYSTATION NETWORK USERNAME  
It will get converted to your account ID using the psn api. 

If it fails you will get prompted to write in your accound ID, you can find it in the folders by looking into the folders of a savefile from your account. 

Your account ID will be saved and you do not need to include the parameter if you want to use the previously stored one.
